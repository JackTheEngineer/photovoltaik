\section{Introduction}
Because of the worsening image of energy from nuclear sources, more precise from nuclear fission, more and more efforts focus on finding ways to find and optimise ways of using renewable energy sources. \newline 
One of these energy sources is the sun, whose energy can be harnessed via solar panels. Because of this different kinds of solar cells and their way of functioning will be introduced and discussed.
