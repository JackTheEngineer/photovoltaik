\section{Used materials}
The materials used for the various measurements were amourphous siclicon, crystalline silicon with a flat side,
crystalline silicon with a rough side, silicon with a pyramidal structure on it's surface,
black silicon and silicon with an antireflective coating for a wavelenght of 660nm.
Black silicon also has a pyramidal structure on it's surface, but the dimensions of
these pyramids are smaller than the absorbing wavelenght. This creates a smooth transition
from the refractive index of air to the refractive index of silicon, sucking in the light.
